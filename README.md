# MHW-Bleaching-Dissertation
This is my GitHub repo where I will be showing the analysis undertaken for my dissertation. The aim of this research is to detect the coral reef zones most susceptible to bleaching in the Caribbean. This will be achieved by producing an atlas of marine heatwave (MHW) hotspots for the region, derived from daily-derived sea surface temperature data, and which can be used as a conservation management tool.
